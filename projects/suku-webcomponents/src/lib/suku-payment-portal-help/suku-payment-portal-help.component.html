      <p>The SUKU Platform utilizes a payment provider, Dwolla, to enable ACH Payments. Please reach out to the SUKU
        help mailbox at support@suku.world if you have any questions regarding payments.</p>
      <b>What is Dwolla?</b>
      <p>Dwolla is a powerful payments platform that securely connects to bank or credit union accounts to enable the
        transfer of money for any individual or organization in the U.S.</p>

      <b>Why is my transaction still pending?</b>
      <p>A bank or credit union transaction usually takes 3–4 business days to complete via the Automated Clearing House
        network (ACH) used by banks to transfer funds. Please note that transfers take longer to complete if over a
        weekend or a holiday.</p>

      <b>Why did the transaction fail?</b>
      <p>Sometimes transactions to or from a bank or credit union can fail. Here are a few reasons why a transaction can
        fail:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Insufficient funds: There are insufficient funds in the sending bank or credit union account to complete the
          transaction.</li>
        <li>Frozen account: A bank or credit union account has been frozen.</li>
        <li>Other reasons: A bank or credit union rejects the transaction for some other reason.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If a transaction fails, please contact your bank or credit union to check on the status of your account. Then
        either re-initiate the transaction or ask your financial institution why the transaction may not be processed.
      </p>

      <b>Why am I being asked for more documentation?</b>
      <p>If we ask for a photo ID:</p>
      <p>Additional information is needed to verify your identity. Please upload one of the following forms of
        identification: An unexpired, current, state-issued driver’s license or identification card OR An unexpired,
        current U.S. passport</p>

      <p>If we ask for a bank statement:</p>
      <p>Additional information is needed to verify that you are an authorized signer on your connected bank or credit
        union account. Please upload a copy of a recent statement.</p>
